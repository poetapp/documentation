# Getting Started with Po.et

Po.et has created an [open API layer](poet-api.md) for publishers, so you can get started quickly recording your works on the Po.et Network.

The **[Po.et API web app](https://explorer.poetnetwork.net)** is Po.et's official key-custody agent. It makes it easier for you to work with Po.et by hiding the complex details of public key management.
