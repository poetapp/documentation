It's time to finally break this guy down into proper microservices.

There shouldn't be almost any code change required at all â€” mostly it should be bootstraping.

## The plan in five simple steps:

1. Add `/src/${moduleName}/index.ts` for each module
1. Update package.json
1. Update docker-compose.yml

### Step 1:  add `index.ts` for each module

Each module's `index.ts` will be similar to our current `index.ts`, except that it'll only instantiate that particular module instead of all of them.

This file will also be responsible for loading configuration, unlike our current approach in which `app` takes care of this. 

As the current `index.ts`, each `index.ts` will need to import side-effecting files (those under `Extensions`).

Everything under `Helpers` will go into its own library, `@po.et/helpers`, for two reasons:
- they will not be directly available to the modules any more once we actually separate them into their own projects with their own `package.json`'s,
- most (if not all) of the functions there are not specific to the Po.et Node and have already been copy-pasted to Frost API.

### Notes

We'll stop using `/src/index.ts` in production, but we'll keep `/src/app.ts` for tests for now.
