We hope that we'll be able to encourage security of the Po.et protocol and software through incentivized collaboration.

We value the input of researchers acting in good faith to help us maintain a high standard for the security and privacy for our users. This includes encouraging responsible vulnerability research and disclosure. Our policy sets out our definition of good faith in the context of finding and reporting vulnerabilities, as well as what you can expect from us in return.

## What is a responsible disclosure policy?
A responsible disclosure policy allows for researchers to collaborate with the Po.et core team to reveal potential vulnerabilities and give us a chance to fix the issue before a public release of the vulnerability. When vulnerabilities are submitted responsibly, it can encourage coordination to minimize the disruption of any services built using Po.et's software.

## What is covered under the responsible disclosures policy and bounty?
Only software directly developed by the Po.et team is covered under this disclosure policy.

Third-party packages/software/plugins or community-built software are not included. If we get a disclosure for outside software, we will not disclose the vulnerability to the third-party as to protect you from any undue legal issues and to ensure you're still eligible for any outstanding bounties that they provide.

Other examples of reports not covered under the responsible disclosures policy include:
  * Findings from physical testing such as office access (e.g. open doors, tailgating);
  * Findings derived primarily from social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing);
  * Findings from applications or systems not listed in the 'Scope' section;
  * UI and UX bugs and spelling mistakes;
  * Network level Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) vulnerabilities

## What software is considered to be 'in scope'?
  * https://github.com/poetapp/node
  * https://github.com/poetapp/frost-client
  * https://github.com/poetapp/frost-api
  * https://github.com/poetapp/explorer-web
  * https://github.com/poetapp/poet-js

## What can you expect from the Po.et team?
When working with us according to this policy, you can expect us to:

  * Extend Safe Harbor for your vulnerability research that is related to this policy
  * Work with you to understand and validate your report, including a timely initial response to the submission
  * Work to remediate discovered vulnerabilities in a timely manner
  * Recognize your contribution to improving our security if you are the first to report a unique vulnerability, and your report triggers a code or configuration change

## What about "safe harbor" protections?
When conducting vulnerability research according to this policy, we consider this research to be:

  * Authorized in accordance with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) (and/or similar state laws), and we will not initiate or support legal action against you for accidental, good faith violations of this policy;
  * Exempt from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and we will not bring a claim against you for circumvention of technology controls;
  * Exempt from restrictions in our Terms & Conditions that would interfere with conducting security research, and we waive those restrictions on a limited basis for work done under this policy; and
  * Lawful, helpful to the overall security of the Internet, and conducted in good faith.
  * You are expected, as always, to comply with all applicable laws.

If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your security research is consistent with this policy, please submit a report through one of our official channels before going any further.

## How do I submit disclosures?
Please email **security@po.et** for all communications.  Do not use other channels such as Twitter, Telegram, or Reddit.

## What about the bug bounty program?
As of October 1st, 2019, we have closed the bug bounty program as we will be transitioning the Po.et protocols to become the Linked Claims protocols. The Po.et team will continue to contribute to the Linked Claims protocols and use it as we develop applications.

## Acknowledgements
Some of the language weâ€™ve used for our policies came from [disclose.io](http://disclose.io), a collaborative and vendor-agnostic project to standardize best practices around safe harbor for good-faith security research.  Weâ€™ve also used language from [Snyk](https://snyk.io/docs/security/#snyk-s-vulnerability-disclosure-program) in prior disclosure documents.

We hope that youâ€™re excited about our approaches to collaborative security and look forward to any vulnerabilities that you may find! ðŸ™‡
